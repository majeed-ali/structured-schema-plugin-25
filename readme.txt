Automatically generate structured data (schema.org JSON-LD) for your WordPress posts, pages, products, and organization info. Improve SEO, visibility, and eligibility for Google rich results.

== Description ==

Structured Schema Generator is a lightweight yet powerful plugin that injects valid [schema.org](https://schema.org) structured data into your website, including:

* Blog posts (`BlogPosting`)
* Pages (`WebPage`)
* Products (`Product`, if WooCommerce is inactive)
* Organization or LocalBusiness
* Aggregate ratings and reviews

It improves your site's SEO and enhances eligibility for Google rich results by embedding `JSON-LD` schema automatically in the `<head>` of your pages.

**Features:**

* Auto-detects post type and generates schema accordingly
* Allows manual input of review star rating and count
* Organization schema with selectable type (Organization, LocalBusiness, etc.)
* Optional disabling of product schema if WooCommerce is active
* Seamless integration with any theme
* Does not bloat the database or affect page speed

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to **Settings > Structured Schema** and configure your schema options.
